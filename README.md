# Laravel Project for Hackeru School: 
A minimalist eshop website, with route protection and CMS functionality.
Within the CMS section, analytics and data visualisation are set in place.
Design was made without the use of template but was heavily inspired by [Nordic Design](https://nordicmade.com/) 
and is completely responsive.
